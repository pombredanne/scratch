        --- Miniterm --- type Ctrl-D to quit
        AT+CSIM=14,"A0A40000027F20"
        +CSIM: 4,"6E00"
        
        OK
        AT+CSIM=10,"A0F2000016"
        +CSIM: 4,"6E00"
        
        OK
        AT+CSIM=14,"A0A40000022FE2"
        +CSIM: 4,"6E00"
        
        OK
        
        --- exit ---
        sysadmin@edc1:~$ miniterm -p /dev/modem
        --- Miniterm --- type Ctrl-D to quit
        AT+CSIM=14,"00A40000027F20"
        +CSIM: 4,"6B00"
        
        OK
        
        --- exit ---
      * returned 6E00 and 6B00 indicates an error (see ETSI TS 131 101
        V3.0.0)
      * command break down 
              * A0 - class (see ETSI TS 151 011 V4.15.0)
              * A4 - command, select like cd
              * F2 - command, status
              * 7F20 - code for ICCID (ETSI TS 151 011 V4.15.0)
              * so A0A4000027F20 selects the file containing ICCID
      * AT+CSIM - see ETSI TS 127 007 V7.4.0
      * AT+CSIM command didn't seemed to work on vodafone branded option
        card 
              * only otherwise tried on a sierra wireless aircard 875
